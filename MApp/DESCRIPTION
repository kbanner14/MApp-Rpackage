Description: A summary plot for model averaging of partial regression
    coefficients allowing the user to plot and compare posterior distributions
    of partial regression coefficients from individual models and compare them
    to the resulting posterior distribution of their model averaged counterpart.
    This function currently works with output from the bms() function in the {BMS}
    package, lists and/or matrices of draws from self-coded MCMC samplers, and
    results from information theoretic based approximations to posterior model
    weights.
