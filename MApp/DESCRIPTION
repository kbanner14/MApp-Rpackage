Description: A summary plot for model averaging of partial regression coefficients
  allowing the user to plot and compare posterior distributions of partial regression
  coefficients from individual models and compare them to their resulting posterior
  distribution of the model averaged coefficient. The plot displays all of the
  relevant output from Bayesian model averaging. This function currently works
  with output from the bms() function in the {bms} package.
