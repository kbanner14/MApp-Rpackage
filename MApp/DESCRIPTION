Description: A summary plot for model averaging of partial regression coefficients
  allowing the user to plot and compare posterior distributions of partial regression
  coefficients from individual models and compare them to the resulting posterior
  distribution of their model averaged counterpart. This function currently works
  with output from the bms() function in the {bms} package, lists and/or matricies of
  draws from self-coded MCMC samplers, and results from information theoretic based
  approximations to posteiror model weights.
