# {MApp}

The `MApp()` function works with lists of posterior draws, the `MApp_MCMC` function works with matricies of posterior draws, and the `MApp_bms()` function works with `bma` objects created by the `BMS::bms` function. A quick introduction to Bayesian model averaging and details about the `bms()` function can be found in the `BMS` package vignette (`vignette("BMS")`). Instructions for using the `MApp` functions are provided in the `my-vignette.Rmd` file. 

To use these functions, the user can download the `MApp/` repository and loading the package 
`devtools::load_all()`. To do this, the `devtools` package must be installed. To install `devtools` run `install.packages("devtools")`.
